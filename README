Hello,

Your task is to create an interactive containing a map and accompanying table using the provided GDP.csv data.

The data MUST be loaded via XHR.

The map should contain markers in the correct location for every country listed with a GDP value.
Clicking a marker will show the country name and GDP value.

The table will contain the country names and GDP values.

    +----------------------------+
    |  Country name |     GDP    |
    +---------------+------------+
    | United States | 16,800,000 |
    |     ...       |     ...    |
    |     ...       |     ...    |
    +----------------------------+

Use whatever tools, additional data, libraries or frameworks you wish.

Please comment the code with your workings out.

Good luck.
